        <div class="mb-3">
            The Service uses the Creative Commons scheme to clearly articulate the license under which Content submitted to the Service is available for access and reuse.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-3">
            Creative Commons <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC0_FAQ">CC0</a> or <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY</a> are encouraged for Content submitted to the Service.

            As outlined in the <a href="/policies/en/data_submission/">Data Submission Policy</a>, embargoes may be applied to Content.

        <div class="mb-3">
            Most Content will be immediately available for download in the browser by any User without registration. To download many files at once, a User may generate a Zip archive with a copy of the data files selected by the User. The Service will email a link to download the Zip archive to a valid User email address. User-generated Zip archives and email addresses will be purged regularly by the Service. In some cases, large files may only be accessible via Globus Transfer, which requires registration and a free software download and installation to use.
