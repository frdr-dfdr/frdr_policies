## 1.0 Scope & Purpose

This policy outlines Collections Development for the Federated Research Data Repository (FRDR) website (the Site), <a href="https://www.frdr-dfdr.ca/">https://www.frdr-dfdr.ca/</a>, and the services available on or at the Site (taken together, the Service), including a definition of acceptable Content and requirements around formatting and language and Content with sensitivities. This policy should be consulted in accordance with the [Terms of Use](/policies/en/terms_of_use/), [Privacy Policy](/policies/en/privacy/), the [Glossary of Terms](/policies/en/glossary/), and any other relevant policies.

## 2.0 Acceptable Content

The Service accepts for deposit collections of research data or datasets. Research data are data that are used as primary sources to support scholarly activity or validate research findings. A dataset is a self-contained collection of data together with its documentation (hereafter: “Content”) that can be understood and utilized without reference to other materials, and may come from any and all domains or subject areas. 

Content may only be submitted to the Service by “Eligible Submitters” as defined by the Submission Policy. Submitters must have intellectual property rights to the Content and are legally able to share it and agree to submission terms defined in the [Data Submission Policy](/policies/en/data_submission/) and the [Terms of Use](/policies/en/terms_of_use/). 

Content must be submitted in a publishable state. It is expected that Content will be drawn from completed projects, or from a completed phase of an ongoing project that is of independent interest.

## 3.0 Formats and Language

Non-proprietary, publicly-documented formats are preferred. Non-proprietary or proprietary formats that are de facto standards in particular fields, or that are widely supported by multiple tools, will also be accepted. Instances where it is not possible to convert the data into one of the above two options will be considered case-by-case. We encourage Submitters to provide any available analysis scripts or code that will aid in reproducibility or further analysis.

Content may be in any language, although curation support will only be offered in Canada’s two official languages, English and French. There must be enough information in English or French to fill out the required descriptive metadata fields.

## 4.0 Content with Sensitivities

Content with sensitivities, defined as data or metadata where the release may cause harm, may only be accepted if it is able to be published openly. Content with sensitivities can include, but is not limited to, environmental information related to endangered species, Personal Information as defined in the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, or Traditional or Indigenous Knowledge. The intent to deposit or to provide access to any data with sensitivities, particularly data related to human subject research, must be included in the appropriate ethical review consistent with the [Tri-Council Policy Statement on Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans (2018)](https://ethics.gc.ca/eng/policy-politique_tcps2-eptc2_2018.html). The Submitter must explicitly transfer administration of access and sharing to the Service in order to not create an undue burden for access. Creation of anonymized or lower-risk versions of datasets in place of sensitive Content is encouraged.

## 5.0 Implementation and Revision

This Policy enters into force on the date of its adoption. It will be reviewed by the FRDR Steering Committee every two years or at any time, as required.
