**Appraisal**: is the process of determining whether a dataset has sufficient long-term archival value to merit acquisition, processing, and preservation.

**Checksum**: a method of verifying the integrity of digital files. Checksums are commonly used for the monitoring of a file’s fixity over time. Checksums are often called a “digital fingerprint” because the checksum algorithm used provides a unique alphanumeric string for a particular manifestation of a file. If a file’s contents are modified in any way, re-calculating the file’s checksum will provide a different alphanumeric string. This allows for the continuous monitoring of fixity, as well as the identification of duplicate files. ([Scholars Portal](https://learn.scholarsportal.info/all-guides/handling-digital-archives/concepts/)).

**Collaborators**: Submitters may designate other FRDR users as Collaborators on a submission. Collaborators will be able to edit Content prior to publication.

**Content**: Data and associated material (e.g., metadata records, software code, ReadMe text, etc.) uploaded to the Service by Submitters.

**Curator**: An individual who has responsibility for managing a set of Content in the Service. This may include but is not limited to making acceptance decisions on submission of Content, auditing and improving metadata, and migrating the Content if necessary.

**Fixity**: Fixity determines whether or not a digital file has been altered or changed. Establishing fixity is a method for ensuring the integrity of files.

**FRDR**: Federated Research Data Repository

**Long-term preservation**: “the series of managed activities necessary to ensure continued access to digital materials for as long as necessary” ([DPC](https://www.dpconline.org/handbook/glossary#D)). Digital preservation combines policies, strategies, and actions to ensure the accurate rendering of authenticated content over time, regardless of the challenges of media failure and technological change. ([ALA](http://www.ala.org/alcts/resources/preserv/defdigpres0408)).

**Migration**: “A means of overcoming technological obsolescence by transferring digital resources from one hardware/software generation to the next. The purpose of migration is to preserve the intellectual content of digital objects and to retain the ability for clients to retrieve, display, and otherwise use them in the face of constantly changing technology.” ([DPC](https://www.dpconline.org/handbook/glossary)).

**Normalization**: An activity that results in digital objects of a particular type converted to a single chosen file format that are non-proprietary and designated preservation friendly. Example jpg, png, gif are normalized to tiff.

**Personal Information**: Personal information is any recorded information that identifies an individual.

**Published Data**: Data in FRDR that is published, under embargo or in external review.

**Selection**: is the process of determining which files constituting a dataset should be retained after long-term archival value has been established.

**Service**: The services available on or at the Site offered by the Service Host.

**Service Host**: The legal entity responsible for offering the Service, being the Digital Research Alliance of Canada (Alliance).

**Site**: Federated Research Data Repository (FRDR) website, https://www.frdr-dfdr.ca/

**Submitted Data**: Data submitted to FRDR but is not published.

**Submitter**: An individual who publishes Content to the Service. It is anticipated that, in the majority of cases, the Submitter will be an author of the Content or associated datasets or a researcher collaborating with the author(s).

**User**: An individual who makes use of the Service by either browsing the Site or downloading Content.
