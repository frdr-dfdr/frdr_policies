        <div class="mb-3">
            This policy governs the long-term preservation of Content published to the <a href="https://www.frdr-dfdr.ca">Federated Research Data Repository (FRDR)</a> website (the Site), and the services available on or at the Site (taken together, the Service). Content deemed appropriate for long-term preservation will be processed and transferred into the care of a network of Preservation Service Providers (PSPs) committed to the ongoing preservation of Canadian research data.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-3">
            The purpose of the Preservation Policy is to establish that the Service will take all reasonable measures to ensure that Content selected for long-term preservation will be retained, and remain trustworthy and accessible.

        <div class="mb-3">
            The Digital Research Alliance of Canada supports Canada's research infrastructure by providing in FRDR a platform through which research data can be ingested, curated, preserved, discovered, cited, and shared. The Service’s digital preservation strategies are directed by this mandate to ensure the persistence of Content submitted to the Service over time. The digital preservation program will comply with the Service’s existing policies, procedures, and relevant applicable legislation.

        <div class="mb-3">
            The following principles underpin the Service’s approach to the preservation of the Content and will help ensure that the Content remains authentic and accessible in the future.
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>Standards and Good Practices: The Service’s preservation activities will align with current standards, models and practices.</li>
            <li>Authenticity and Integrity: The Service will implement preservation strategies, persistent identifiers, and document provenance to ensure the authenticity of the Content. Fixity checks and the capture of preservation actions performed on the Content will ensure integrity.</li>
            <li>Metadata: The Service will capture and document metadata, (administrative, technical, and descriptive), so the Content can be understood and used.</li>
            <li>Access: The Service will maintain a registry of all preserved datasets transferred to PSPs and will endeavour to provide access to preservation copies upon request. Descriptive metadata will be retained for all Content, regardless of the disposition of associated data.</li>
            <li>Technical Capacity: The Service will invest and maintain the appropriate hardware, software, and storage to ensure the long-term viability of the Content. </li>
            <li>Community Engagement and Collaboration: The Service will engage with the digital preservation community and stakeholders at the local, national, and international level.</li>

        <div class="mb-3">
            In all cases the Service will preserve copies of the original files published, alongside any other manifestations created during preservation processing for the purpose of mitigating against technological obsolescence and will carry out the following digital preservation activities:
        </div>

        <ul>
             <li>Monitoring: Checksums will be calculated for individual files and retained. Fixity checks will be used to ensure ongoing file integrity.</li>
             <li>Replication: Preservation copies will be stored in multiple, geographically distributed locations.</li>
             <li>Migration: Content will be migrated to new file formats, where necessary and possible, to ensure ongoing accessibility.</li>
             <li>Continuation of care: Preservation copies of Content will be retained long-term in accordance with the Service’s <a href="/policies/en/data_retention/">Data Retention and Deaccession Policy</a>.</li>

        <h2 id="60-selection-and-appraisal">6.0 Selection and Appraisal</h2>

        <div class="mb-3">
            All Content published to the Service will be evaluated for long-term preservation by the Service Host, using an appraisal guidance framework developed to support best practices in the field. Content determined to have long-term preservation value beyond the active life of the dataset in the repository, governed by the <a href="/policies/en/data_retention/">Data Retention and Deaccession Policy</a>, may be selected for long-term preservation.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-3">
            Submitters can contribute to appraisal and selection by considering what will be required for others to understand and reproduce their research. They should ensure files are well organized and described to support the work of the Curators and the Preservation Coordinator, who will make appraisal decisions on behalf of the Service.

            The roles and responsibilities of Canadian memory institutions and preservation providers in the Service are subject to change and may be amended from time to time.
