            <li>Adoption of recognized metadata standards; </li>
            <li>Data documentation, e.g., describing data using both domain-relevant and generalized terminology so that others may understand how and why the data, code, models, etc. were produced;</li>
            <li>Linking research data documentation to author PIDs (e.g., ORCIDs) and, where relevant, grant information;</li>
            <li>Linking research data documentation to other research products, e.g., data management plan, data paper, journal article;</li>
            <li>Technical review, e.g., analysis of scripts and codes, ensuring that descriptions of any data cleaning, de-identification, or quality assurance processes are documented and included in the submission;</li>

            The Submitter is responsible for reviewing the Terms of Use and any other relevant policies, including the Submitter's own institutional policies, and ensuring that Content complies with these policies and is suitable for open dissemination.

        <div class="mb-3">
            Submitters are responsible for participating in the Curation process, including responding to queries from Curators about the Content. Submitters are expected to make good faith efforts, as appropriate, to improve the submission in accordance with guidance from Curators. Such proposed improvements may include identifying the least restrictive licensing options, or other modifications to the submission to make the Content more FAIR <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/</a>.
        </div>

        <div class="mb-3">
            Curators are responsible for taking reasonable steps to review and approve Content such that it adheres to the Collections Development Policy, and the data quality standards described above.

        <div class="mb-3">
            Submitters may request that Content be embargoed for a period after which point the Content will become publicly accessible.

Reasons for granting an embargo could include:
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>If making Content publicly accessible would jeopardise a forthcoming publication, thesis, dissertation, etc.</li>
            <li>If immediate release of the Content would violate institutional ethics approvals</li>
            <li>If the immediate release of the Content would cause potential harms to research subjects (e.g., human participants or species at risk data)</li>
            <li>If the release of the Content could jeopardize the intellectual property of an industry partner</li>
